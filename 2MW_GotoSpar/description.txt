Primary input files for the ElastoDyn, HydroDyn and MoorDyn modules of OpenFAST, compatible with OpenFAST 2.3.0. 

Files describe the structural, hydrodynamic and mooring system properties of a 2MW turbine on a spar platform, based on the floating turbine Haenkaze. HydroData contains the hydrostatic, added mass and damping properties (generated using WAMIT) of the spar platform required to obtain a first order potential flow solution in HydroDyn. 

Turbine properties were defined based on available information for Haenkaze [1] and the Hitachi HWT2.0-80 turbine. Platform mass properties are estimated based on available information. Nacelle, hub and drivetrain properties are from the UT80d-2.0MW downwind turbine [2]. Additional yaw stiffness and damping is added in HydroDyn for model stability.
