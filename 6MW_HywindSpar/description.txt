Primary input files for the ElastoDyn, HydroDyn and MoorDyn modules of OpenFAST, compatible with OpenFAST 2.3.0. 

Files describe the structural, hydrodynamic and mooring system properties of a 6MW turbine on a spar platform, based on the Hywind Scotland turbines. HydroData contains the hydrostatic, added mass and damping properties (generated using WAMIT) of the spar platform required to obtain a first order potential flow solution in HydroDyn. 

Turbine properties were defined based on available information for the SWT-6.0-154 turbine and the Hywind Scotland floating wind farm [1]. Individual component mass properties are estimated based on a combination of available information and properties of the NREL 5 MW reference turbine [2]. Nacelle and rotor shaft configuration are the same as those for the NREL 5 MW turbine due to lack of available information. Additional linear yaw damping is added in HydroDyn for model stability.
